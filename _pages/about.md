I’m an Applied Scientist at AWS AI in Berlin, where I work on [AutoGluon](https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon).
Currently my research focuses on time series forecasting and AutoML.

I did a PhD in machine learning at the Technical University of Munich, supervised by [Stephan Günnemann](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/daml/).
During my PhD I primarily worked on temporal point processes (TPPs) — probabilistic models for continuous-time event sequences, such as user activity on social media or earthquake sequences in seismology.

If you want to learn more about my research, have a look at my [blog](/blog/) or my [PhD thesis](/assets/pdf/phd-thesis.pdf).
